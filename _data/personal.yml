intro:
  title: Welcome to my personal website!
  body: >
    I'm an Assistant Prof. of Industrial and Sytems Engineering at Istinye University in Istanbul.
    Turkey. I obtained a BSc. in Management Engineering from Istanbul Technical University (2006), followed by an MSc. (2011) and a
    PhD. (2016) in Financial Mathematics from the Institute of Applied Mathematics at Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey.
    I carried out (and fortunately finalized!) my doctoral thesis studies at the Financial Signal Processing (FSP) Lab at Imperial College London.
    During my graduate studies, I was also granted research fellowships at Heidelberg and Ulm Universities. Between 2011 and 2016, I worked as
    a senior research economist at an inter-governmental organization and managed multi-stakeholder projects focusing on financial
    sector development. Prior to Istinye University, Dr Aydin was part-time faculty at the Department of Industrial Engineering
    at TED University in Ankara, Turkey. He is a designated Financial Risk Manager (FRM) and continues to offer professional training
    courses in partnership with the industry. He is also serving on the editorial board of a number of international journals and review services.
    Dr. Aydinâ€™s research interest lies in computational finance, stochastic risk modelling, financial optimization, predictive data analytics, pattern
    recognition, statistical/machine learning, and financial signal processing.

    # [My dissertation](http://ianli.com/thesis/) explored how contextual information can improve self-knowledge in personal informatics systems.
