<a href=academics.htm><image src=images\minus.jpg border=0></a> Aydin, N. S., Pricing Power Derivatives: Electricity Swing Options, Master's Thesis, Advised  by Prof. Dr. Rüdiger Kiesel, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany, 2010<br><br>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 bordercolor=000000><tr><td width=50% align=left><font size=2 face=times>The Swing options are the natural outcomes of the increasing uncertainty in the power markets, which came along with the deregulation process triggered by the UK government's action in 1990 to privatize the national electricity supply industry.
Since then, the ways of handling the risks in the price generation process have been explored extensively. Producer-consumers of the power market felt confident as they were naturally hedged against the price fluctuations surrounding the large
consumers. Companies with high power consumption liabilities on their books demanded tailored nancial products that would shelter them from the upside risks while not preventing them from benefiting the low prices.<br><br>
More effective risk management practices are strongly dependent upon the successful parameterization of the underlying stochastic processes, which is also key to the effective pricing of derivatives traded in the market. In this thesis, we introduce
an electricity spot price model, which incorporates jumps and still maintains the analytical tractability. We also derive the forward curve dynamics implied by the spot price model and apply it to generalize Black's 1976 formula so that it incorporates
the jump-driven dynamics of the model. As the main discussion of this thesis, the Grid Approach, which is a generalization of the Trinomial Forest Method, is applied to the electricity Swing options. We investigate the effects of spikes on the
per right values of the Swing options with various number of exercise rights, as well as the sensitivities of the model-implied prices to several parameters. <a href=theses\msc-thesis-nsa.pdf>Get the full version</a></font></td></tr></table><br><br>

Stress testing has recently been an important risk management tool to both complement and supplement risk measurement methods under different stress scenarios. It is already a part of Basel II capital rules introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This paper
performs thorough backtests under widely used risk models in combination with different conditional volatility frameworks to identify the most suitable risk model specification for structured energy instruments mostly traded in financial markets and conducts a stress test
based on the specified models. We find strong evidence that, for a smaller estimation window, the volatility model that incorporates asymmetric volatility response together with Student’s t innovations clearly outperforms symmetric ones. However, the conditional empirical model is
superior when larger estimation windows are considered. Also, it is shown that the backtest performances of volatility models are substantially affected by the distribution selection. Stress test results clearly indicate that energy shocks can lead greater stress losses than those
observed in major currency pairs. Associated with an appropriate initial shock and estimation window size, the stress losses estimated by the selected models favorably compare with past shocks in all but one extraordinary case: the 1st Gulf War scenarios ended in the largest ever
price drops. Referring to Basel II capital calculation rules, the results imply the need for significant risk capital buffers for energy portfolios.

Stress testing has recently been an important risk management tool to both complement and supplement risk measurement methods under different stress scenarios. It is already a part of Basel II
capital rules introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. These rules allow banks to use their own internal models to assess how much capital they should set aside against potential
losses, but they also require banks to follow a regular back-testing schedule as well as a routine and rigorous program of stress-testing for the assumptions produced by these risk models. However,
many banks' stress-testing practices was inadequate in the run-up to most recent shock in the energy prices, leaving them unprepared with a large amount of energy derivatives when markets were
distressed. This paper performs thorough backtests under three widely used risk models in combination with two different conditional volatility frameworks to identify the most suitable risk
model specification for structured energy instruments mostly traded in financial markets and conducts a stress test based on the specified models. We find strong evidence that, for a smaller
estimation window, the volatility model that incorporates asymmetric volatility response together with Student’s t innovations clearly outperforms symmetric ones. However, the conditional empirical
model is superior when larger estimation windows are considered. Also, it is shown that the performances of volatility models are substantially affected by the distribution selected. Stress test
results clearly indicate that energy shocks can lead greater stress losses than those observed in major currency pairs. Associated with an appropriate initial shock and estimation window size, the selected
models favorably compare with past shocks in all but one extraordinary case: the Gulf War scenarios ended in the biggest single-day price drop ever. The results also support that, when compared to
traditional stress tests, the model based stress tests are able to simulate any number of paths which are different from, but consistent with, those experienced historically. We also explored the effects of
estimation window selection for modeling volatility in energy derivatives market. It is found that working with a larger estimation window significantly improves the backtests results, especially in
conditional empirical case, while it leads poorer results for heavy-tailed asymmetric GARCH model resulting in excessively conservative VaR estimates.

<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 bordercolor=000000><tr><td><font size=2 face=times>
The main proposal made in this paper is to use a Markov-switching model in order to determine soaring-confidence and plunging-confidence periods of U.S. economy using U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index data3. The differences of index values are used to obtain a stationary
series and exploit, if appropriate, autoregressive modeling whereas the transition between different phases of confidence is modeled via a first-order Markov process. A Bayesian approach, namely Gibbs sampling, is adopted to determine the probability of being in a decaying confidence
period at any given point in time, which has a number of implications for policy makers beforehand.

H., On the Existence of Energy Intensity Convergence for Eurasia Countries to EU15 and OECD levels: A Panel Data Approach, Research Project for the partial fulfilment of the course Energy Trade and Risk Management, 2008<br><br>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 bordercolor=000000><tr><td><font size=2 face=times>
This study examines the relationship between the energy intensity in 15 Eurasia countries and that in the EU15 and OECD countries. The historical data clearly have some evidence of convergence in levels of intensity.
We conclude that a detailed model including lagged adjustments confirms the existence of convergence, however, during the forecasted period, only some countries in the control group will probably able to reduce their energy
intensities to EU15 and OECD levels. The study, to some extent, can be seen as the expansion of the model studied by Markandya, Pedroso-Galinato and Streimikiene (2006) to a larger group of countries in a more recent
period. <a href=seminar-presentations\crisis_of_mathematical_abuse_and_misuse.pdf>Get the full version</a></font>
