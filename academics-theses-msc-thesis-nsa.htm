<a href=academics.htm><image src=images\minus.jpg border=0></a> Aydin, N. S., Pricing Power Derivatives: Electricity Swing Options, Master's Thesis, Advised  by Prof. Dr. Rüdiger Kiesel, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany, 2010<br><br>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 bordercolor=000000><tr><td width=50% align=left><font size=2 face=times>The Swing options are the natural outcomes of the increasing uncertainty in the power markets, which came along with the deregulation process triggered by the UK government's action in 1990 to privatize the national electricity supply industry.
Since then, the ways of handling the risks in the price generation process have been explored extensively. Producer-consumers of the power market felt confident as they were naturally hedged against the price fluctuations surrounding the large
consumers. Companies with high power consumption liabilities on their books demanded tailored nancial products that would shelter them from the upside risks while not preventing them from benefiting the low prices.<br><br>
More effective risk management practices are strongly dependent upon the successful parameterization of the underlying stochastic processes, which is also key to the effective pricing of derivatives traded in the market. In this thesis, we introduce
an electricity spot price model, which incorporates jumps and still maintains the analytical tractability. We also derive the forward curve dynamics implied by the spot price model and apply it to generalize Black's 1976 formula so that it incorporates
the jump-driven dynamics of the model. As the main discussion of this thesis, the Grid Approach, which is a generalization of the Trinomial Forest Method, is applied to the electricity Swing options. We investigate the effects of spikes on the
per right values of the Swing options with various number of exercise rights, as well as the sensitivities of the model-implied prices to several parameters. <a href=theses\msc-thesis-nsa.pdf>Get the full version</a></font></td></tr></table><br><br>
