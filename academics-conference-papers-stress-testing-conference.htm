Stress testing has recently been an important risk management tool to both complement and supplement risk measurement methods under different stress scenarios. It is already a part of Basel II
capital rules introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. These rules allow banks to use their own internal models to assess how much capital they should set aside against potential
losses, but they also require banks to follow a regular back-testing schedule as well as a routine and rigorous program of stress-testing for the assumptions produced by these risk models. However,
many banks' stress-testing practices was inadequate in the run-up to most recent shock in the energy prices, leaving them unprepared with a large amount of energy derivatives when markets were
distressed. This paper performs thorough backtests under three widely used risk models in combination with two different conditional volatility frameworks to identify the most suitable risk
model specification for structured energy instruments mostly traded in financial markets and conducts a stress test based on the specified models. We find strong evidence that, for a smaller
estimation window, the volatility model that incorporates asymmetric volatility response together with Student’s t innovations clearly outperforms symmetric ones. However, the conditional empirical
model is superior when larger estimation windows are considered. Also, it is shown that the performances of volatility models are substantially affected by the distribution selected. Stress test
results clearly indicate that energy shocks can lead greater stress losses than those observed in major currency pairs. Associated with an appropriate initial shock and estimation window size, the selected
models favorably compare with past shocks in all but one extraordinary case: the Gulf War scenarios ended in the biggest single-day price drop ever. The results also support that, when compared to
traditional stress tests, the model based stress tests are able to simulate any number of paths which are different from, but consistent with, those experienced historically. We also explored the effects of
estimation window selection for modeling volatility in energy derivatives market. It is found that working with a larger estimation window significantly improves the backtests results, especially in
conditional empirical case, while it leads poorer results for heavy-tailed asymmetric GARCH model resulting in excessively conservative VaR estimates.
